## Installation

Click on a URL leading to this web-page.

## Usage

Click the URL to open the webpage. To open the hamburger menu, hover over it with your mouse, or tap it if you are on a mobile device. A menu of items should extend out that will help you navigate the webpage. You can also hover - or tap - the portfolio items on the left to highlight them. Clicking or tapping again should take you to a new webpage with more information about the piece. 

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to create an Issue on the application's GitHub repo or contact me in another fashion.

## Tests

Please hover over the boxes within the large container on the left. The boxes should grow in size slightly and change color. You can also click the boxes to go to another website where the work is hosted. Alternatively, hovering over the hamburger menu in the header - or the square with the "=" in it - should extend a menu of shortcuts to different sections of the web-page. Please try them out to ensure the website functions properly.
